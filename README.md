Image coordinates for subdividing source images of La Bible Moralisée on Gallica.bnf.fr


The Bible Moralisée is a medieval manuscript tradition that illustrates each episode of the Bible along with accompanying moralized interpretations. 

A detailed description of these works is presented by John Lowden in his two-volume study on the Making of the Bibles Moralisées (Penn State University Press, 2000). According to Lowden, only seven copies of this work survive today. So far, only two manuscripts are included in this repository. These are the latest copies and are both found in the Bibliothèque Nationale de France: manuscripts Fr. 167, dating from the end of the fourteenth century, and Fr. 166, which dates to the beginning of the fifteenth century. Lowden provides a detailed examination of each of these manuscripts in his first volume, pages 221-250 and 251-284 respectively.

These two manuscripts were selected for comparison in particular because (1) they represent the end of the tradition; (2) because of the direct relationship of the earlier manuscript serving as the model for the later; (3) because Fr. 167 is the longest and most complete representation of the Bible of any of the other Bibles Moralisées; (4) because of the accessibility of the images via IIIF API. Note that the two manuscripts collate extremely closely, but that Fr. 166 is incomplete and stops in the middle of the Book of Isaiah.

The images for these manuscripts are all maintained and served directly from the resources of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BNF) as made available through Gallica.bnf.fr. The data in this repository allows these images to be cropped and presented using the API of the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) which these institutions have generously adopted. Permission for the re-use of these images can be granted only under the terms of Gallica and the BNF. 

Both manuscripts are organized in the following way. Each page is divided into four sections or quadrants. Each quadrant contains two illustrations—the first of which depicts a scene from the Bible (ABCD); the second depicts the interpretation of that scene (abcd). Both images have descriptive captions written in both Latin and Middle French.
